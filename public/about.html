<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Bashar Bahjat. I’m an 18-year-old junior web developer with a strong passion for creating responsive, user-friendly websites. I enjoy turning ideas into functional and visually appealing digital experiences.</p>

<p>With a growing foundation in modern web technologies, I continuously strive to expand my skills and stay up-to-date with the latest trends in web development. Whether it's front-end interfaces or back-end logic, I love exploring new challenges and building solutions that make an impact.</p>

<p>Outside of coding, I’m always curious and eager to learn more—not just about web development, but about anything that helps me grow as a creator and problem solver. I believe that every line of code is a step toward building something meaningful.</p>
